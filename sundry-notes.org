* The source repository of XKB configurations

Apparently this is where you can find the releases of the “source” of
the XKB configuration that comes installed on Linux etc.:

https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/XKeyboardConfig/

I downloaded the repository and indeed it looks similar my XKB
configuration located at ~/usr/share/X11/xkb/~.  The directory structure
looks the same, and I opened the Norwegian (~no~) keyboard mapping file
and it looked similar to the one I have on my system.

* Example of custom configurations

Adam Spiers has a repository which among other things contains custom
keymappings, keycodes, and geometry:

https://github.com/aspiers/desktop-config/tree/master/.xkb

His keymappings (the ~symbols~ directory) might be useful to look at in
order to figure out how to structure things.
