* Can't map a key to use five or more levels

When I make a map looking like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC generic
key <AB09> { [ period, colon, periodcentered, abovedot, a, b, c, d ] };
#+END_SRC

In other words, a key with eight levels, the key doesn't work properly any more.
I can still access the first and second levels, but not the third and fourth (or
the ones beyond that).

** TODO Fix this issue when I need more than four levels

I won't fix this right away, since I still have convenient access to four levels
right now, and I need to (1) make better mappings for levels 3 and 4, (2) make
some "compose" key sequences of my own, and (3) get used to using this new
setup. It only makes sense to worry about levels five to eight after I have done
all of that.
