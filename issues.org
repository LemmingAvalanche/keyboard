* "AltGr" button produces newline when quickly pressed

This is due to the way I have mapped the "Return" key to "ISO_Level3_Shift", and
then this modifier back to produce the "Return" action/character when pressed.
Since "AltGr" is the original (only) character that was mapped to that
modifier, they now both emit the keycode 255 when pressed rapidly (255 is the
unused keycode that I mapped to the "Return" key).

This is not a practical issue right now, since I never press the "AltGr" key
rapidly by mistake. But it could become an issue when I am going to map "Caps
Lock" to act as another level 3 modifier when held down and pressed with other
keys.
