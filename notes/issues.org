* TODO make test script for the keymappings

Make a test script for the keymappings to run on every commit.  This to
make sure that silly mistakes like parsing errors or using wrong
includes don’t sneak in.

I just found out that I used the wrong includes in my keymappings file.
I should take steps to avoid this in the future.

* TODO What do the rest of the “multi-character” and “international” keys do?

~keysymdef.h~ contains this section:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/* International & multi-key character composition */

#define XK_Multi_key                     0xff20  /* Multi-key character compose */
#define XK_Codeinput                     0xff37
#define XK_SingleCandidate               0xff3c
#define XK_MultipleCandidate             0xff3d
#define XK_PreviousCandidate             0xff3e
#+END_EXAMPLE

I know and use multi key, but what do the rest of the keys do?  Could
they be useful to me?  I want to find out.  My suspicion is that they
have to do with input methods for things like Asian languages.

I googled this and found this on the “Unreliable guide to XKB”:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The file /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/localename/Compose contains the list
of compose sequences for a particular locale or encoding (eg. iso8859-2)
and what they produce. (There are other composition keys, such as
Codeinput, but I don't know what they do.

** Update 2017-11-12T22:07:44+01:00

You can get some more hints about these keys by trying to search for
aliases for them.  Like `Mode_switch`, it seems that there are several
aliases which are more specifically named for their intended purpose.

For example, if you search for ~codeinput~ you will find these other
keysyms:

#+BEGIN_SRC
#define XK_Kanji_Bangou                  0xff37  /* Codeinput */
…
#define XK_Hangul_Codeinput              0xff37  /* Hangul code input mode */
#+END_SRC

For the “candidate” keysyms you should probably search for ~candidate~
and not ~multiplecandidate~ or ~singlecandidate~.  It will give you more
results.

* Closed issues

** DONE Extend layer is not working right now :issue-closed:
   CLOSED: [2017-11-01 Wed 00:37]

  - CLOSING NOTE [2017-11-01 Wed 00:37] \\
    It seems to be a problem with Xkbcomp 1.4.0.  Using version 1.3.1
    instead solves the problem.
The extend layer does not work.  I am unable to use keys like “home”,
“end”, “page down”, etc. through this layer.  I suspect that this might
be due to a version change in one of the tools that I am using to
compile the keyboard layouts.  The reason for that is that I recently
upgraded my OS and so I might have gotten a new version of one of the
programs.

** Can't map a key to use five or more levels :issue-closed:

When I make a map looking like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC generic
key <AB09> { [ period, colon, periodcentered, abovedot, a, b, c, d ] };
#+END_SRC

In other words, a key with eight levels, the key doesn't work properly any more.
I can still access the first and second levels, but not the third and fourth (or
the ones beyond that).

*** DONE Fix this issue when I need more than four levels
CLOSED: [2016-10-15 lø. 19:07]
- CLOSING NOTE [2016-10-15 lø. 19:07] \\
  This issue was resolved in commit r#d721475e30e0 (“Add access to
  levels 5–8”, 2016-10-08).
I won't fix this right away, since I still have convenient access to four levels
right now, and I need to (1) make better mappings for levels 3 and 4, (2) make
some "compose" key sequences of my own, and (3) get used to using this new
setup. It only makes sense to worry about levels five to eight after I have done
all of that.

** Note that depressing all shift keys on the left side of the at the keyboard introduces jamming :issue-closed:

*Update 2017-10-25*: Key ghosting can of course not be solved in
software; you need a keyboard with n-key rollover.  In any case the
issue is not very relevant any more, at least for the higher layouts
like ~no-p5~ (it’s been a while since I used layouts like ~no-p1~.

---

When I try to press all shift levels on the left side of the keyboard, the third
key won't register. I think this is because of keyboard jamming, i.e., that
these keys use the same circuits (or something) which limits how many of them
can be depressed simultaneuosly.

This is not a problem for the shift keys on the right side of the keyboard; when
I depress "Return", "BKSL" and "Shift_R" at the same time, all keypresses are
registered[fn:xev_note].

Short of using another keyboard, I can't really solve this issue. But I thought
I should make a not of it in case I get confused about it in the future.

Note that this does not induce a big limitation. It only means that I can't
conveniently access the eight level. It seems like I can still access the sixth
and seventh level, or at least most of the keys; pressing "Caps_Lock" and "LSGT"
at the same time makes a few of the "shiftable" keys on the right side of the
keyboard jam, but most of the other keys on the right side work.

[fn:xev_note] Found out by running ~xev~.

** Find a way to compile and use configurations without having to be root :issue-closed:

*Update 2017-10-25*: This issue is not relevant any more since I mirror
the directory tree of Xkb which lets me set the layouts with Setxbmap
directly.  This means that I point directly to the layouts instead of
copying the layouts to ~/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols~ using ~sudo~.

---

My current setup means that I need sudo privileges in order to use them; I copy
the configuration files to ~/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/~ directory. This means
that I can’t use these configurations on computers that aren’t my own. I should
find a way to compile and use these files as a regular user. For example, maybe
there is some dot file or configuration file related to X11 that could handle
this in a neat way?

*** DONE Find a way to use these files without sudo privileges
    CLOSED: [2017-06-04 sø. 19:05]

   - CLOSING NOTE [2017-06-04 sø. 19:05] \\
     I seem to have found a way to compile and use keymap files without
     sudo privileges.

     This method seems to be restricted to use /one/ custom file, since
     the `include` statements etc. in that file seems to probably use
     the files in the “standard” directory — ~/usr/share/X11/xkb/~ in my
     case.  If that’s the case, then that drawback will be workable for
     me, since I just need to put all things that depend on each other
     in the same file.

     So the method is this:

     #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     setxkbmap <mapping> -print | xkbcomp -I<custom directory> - "$DISPLAY"
     #+END_SRC

     This prints the mapping and pipes it to a compiler, and then
     finally it is passed to the display ~DISPLAY~.

     Something strange is the way the argument to ~-I~ is right next to
     it, for example (with a concrete string):

     #+BEGIN_SRC
     -I"xkb-from-usr/"
     #+END_SRC

     This weirdness is on purpose since this:

     #+BEGIN_SRC
     -I "xkb-from-usr/"
     #+END_SRC

     Seems like it doesn’t work.

*** Update [2017-06-04 sø.]

I downloaded [[https://github.com/aspiers/desktop-config][Adam Spier’s]] keyboard configuration.  He has some custom
keyboard mappings.  By figuring out how he uses ~setxkbmap~ to enable
his custom mappings, I could perhaps figure out how to do the same and
in turn be able to use my own mappings without sudo priviliges.

I need a project name for these configurations.  I want to name the
keymapping file after the project.


** DONE Make experimental keymapping using numeric row :issue-closed:
   CLOSED: [2017-07-03 ma. 20:10]

  - CLOSING NOTE [2017-07-03 ma. 20:10] \\
    This has been implemented in keymapping ~no-p3~.
I had the idea today that I could use my numeric row for some things.
Namely:

- Symmetric compose keys.
- Symmetric 1st and 2nd level shift keys.  Either normal, or the “press
  once and release and then press the key to be modified” (I don’t know
  the term for this right now).

I would map these keys to some keys used by the index, middle, and/or
ring fingers.

The initial idea was at first to get a more comfortable or ergonomic
compose keys by placing them on two of the numeric keys accessed by the
index fingers on either side (symmetric).  Then I would place those
now-missing numbers (perhaps 4 and 7) on one of the free keys on the
numeric row on the far left and far right.  They are free since now they
are not used as compose keys, and they are not used as symbol keys since
I access the symbol keys on the alphabetic row.

The more radical next step is to replace more of the numeric keys with
things like 1st and 2nd level shift — and perhaps even more stuff.  Then
I would not be able to use the numeric row for producing numbers.

*** What about producing numbers?

The most “radical” version of this scheme is to put both compose and
shift keys on the numeric row.  But then I would need to find some other
place for producing numbers.  What i could do — and which is an idea that
I’ve had separately of this idea — is to make a “numpad” on the
alphabetic section.  this would be achieved by assigning some shift
level to these keys.  For example, maybe use the fifth level?

*** Problems

What comes to my mind as the biggest drawback of this approach is that
it could become hard to use number keys together with control, alt, and
the super keys (Windows keys).  Xmonad uses ~S-<num>~ to change to
desktop ~<num>~.  On the other hand, I can’t immediately think of other
applications that uses the control, alt, or super keys together with
numbers and that I also use.

One way to mitigate this would be to have an alternative keyboard layout
to switch to when it becomes more convenient to use the numberic row.

** Keyboard scripts :issue-closed:

*** "AltGr" button produces newline when quickly pressed

*Update 2017-10-25*: This is not relevant any more.  I think the issue
was due to how I messed around with keycodes in keyboard setup script
that I used.

---

This is due to the way I have mapped the "Return" key to "ISO_Level3_Shift", and
then this modifier back to produce the "Return" action/character when pressed.
Since "AltGr" is the original (only) character that was mapped to that
modifier, they now both emit the keycode 255 when pressed rapidly (255 is the
unused keycode that I mapped to the "Return" key).

This is not a practical issue right now, since I never press the "AltGr" key
rapidly by mistake. But it could become an issue when I am going to map "Caps
Lock" to act as another level 3 modifier when held down and pressed with other
keys.

*** I should use ~setxkbmap~ instead of ~xmodmap~

*Update 2017-10-25*: I exclusively use Setxbmap and haven’t used Xmodmap
in a long time.

---

I should use ~setxkbmap~ instead of ~xmodmap~ to map keys in the script, since
~xmodmap~ seems to be effectively deprecated in favour of ~setxkbmap~ in Ubuntu.
Also, apparently running a ~setxkbmap~ after having run an ~xmodmap~ command
might invalidate whatever changes the ~xmodmap~ invocation made.

*** The order matters when combining level 2 and level 3 shifts

*Update 2017-10-25*: I solved this when I started setting up the
modifiers in a better way; see the last subsection for the update about
that.

---

This only happens for the ~<BKSL>~ key.

If I press and hold the ~<BKSL>~ key, and then press and hold the ~<Shift_R>~
key (while still holding down ~<BKSL>~), then I enter level 4 (level 2 and level
3 shift pressed at the same time). But if I press and hold ~<Shift_R>~ /and
then/ press and hold ~<BKSL>~, then I am still at level 2. This is not the case
for the ~<Alt_R>~ (also known as "Alt Gr") key; I can press and release this key
and ~<Shift_R>~ in any order and they still work as expected, namely that the
fourth level is accessed whenever both are depressed at the same time.

At first I thought that this had something to do with the fact that ~<Alt_R>~
was the original (and only) "level 3 shift", and that I had used ~xmodmap~ to
make ~<BKSL>~ a "level 3 shift" key. But this is /not/ an issue when it comes to
~<Caps_Lock>~ and ~<Shift_L>~; they work just as well as ~<Alt_R>~ combined with
~<Shift_R>~.

**** Update 1

When pressing ~<BKSL>~ while running ~xev~, the "KeyPress event" registers the
keysym as "ISO_Level3_Shift", but the "KeyRelease event" registers the keysym as
"NoSymbol". This is /not/ the case for the "Caps_Lock" key; both the key press
and release events registers the keysym as "ISO_Level3_Shift".

This might be relevant to this issue.

**** Update 2

***** Not key ghosting

I did some testing in ~xev~. I suspected that it might have to do with key
ghosting, but that does not seem to be the case, since ~xev~ manages to register
both keys (~Shift_R~ and ~BKSL~) while one of them is first held down, no matter
what order they are depressed in[fn:higher_levels].

[fn:higher_levels] Moreover, it also manages to register the keypresses when
both of these keys and ~Return~ in addition are pressed down, and apparently in
whatever order. This is nice, since I feared that key ghosting would mean that I
could not hold down these keys together and have them all register. (These three
keys activate all the three shift levels, which means that I get access to the
eight level when I depress them simultaneusly.)

***** ~NoSymbol~ key when pressed after ~Shift_R~

When I depress and hold ~Shift_R~ and then depress ~BKSL~, the keysym for this
key is hex value 0x0, ~NoSymbol~.

I think this is due to xkb thinking that ~BKSL~ is supposed to a "shiftable
key" and not a modifier key. So when shift is held down and ~BKSL~ is pressed as
well, a lookup is made to see what symbol should be produced. And since ~BKSL~
has no /levels/ any more, it gets registers as being a "no symbol".

I think what I need to do is to register ~BKSL~ in the ~no_p1~ file so that it
won't get mistaken for a "shiftable" key (like the alphanumeric keys).

***** Also a problem for ~LSGT~

~LSGT~ also has this issue. Which is not surprising, since it too was
originally a "shiftable key".

**** Update 3: Issue resolved

I fixed the issue by editing the ~no_p1~ file (see the git repository for that
file). Basically I used the xkb construct ~modifier_map~ to declare ~BKSL~ and
~LSGT~ to be ~mod3~ and ~mod5~, respectively. I also had to map all levels of
these keys to their respective shift levels.

** Re-running script causes ~Return~ key to produce multiple newlines :issue-closed:

*Update 2017-10-25*: This is not relevant any more since I don’t use
Xcape (I think that was what was causing it).

---

When I re-run the script (perhaps because I ran some ~setxkbmap~ command and
that nullified the changes done by ~xmodmap~), the ~Return~ key starts producing
more than one newlines. It seems that the more times I run the script, the more
newlines it produces.

** Previous commit introduced errors :issue-closed:

The previous commit introduced these issues:

- Caps lock no longer works as a modifier.
- Caps lock acts as caps lock again.

This is—in hindsight—quite understandable; I deleted the ~xmodmap~ invocation
that mapped "CAPS" to ~modifier_3~. Since that is gone, and my configuration
(the "no_p1" Xkb configuration file) doesn’t change the default behaviour of
"CAPS", then of course it goes back to working as caps lock.

*** Update: issue resolved

I added the following line to my "no_p1" keyboard configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC generic
include "level3(caps_switch)"
#+END_SRC

Which nicely does what I currently want; "CAPS" acts as a level 3 switch and
nothing else (i.e., not a dual purpose key).

** DONE option ~altwin(swap_alt_win)~ does not work for ~no-p2~ :issue-closed:
   CLOSED: [2017-06-23 fr. 20:54]
  - CLOSING NOTE [2017-06-23 fr. 20:54] \\
    Changing this line:

        include "level3(ralt_alt)"

    To this:

        key <RALT> { [ Alt_R ] };

    Seems to be what fixed the issue.
Using this line for ~no-p2~ does not work:

#+BEGIN_SRC
include "altwin(swap_alt_win)"
#+END_SRC

However, this works:

#+BEGIN_SRC
setxkbmap -option altwin:swap_alt_win "no(nodeadkeys)"
#+END_SRC

So there must be something wrong with my keymappings.  Probably with one
of the alt keys.

*** What Emacs says

Using the not-functioning ~no-p2~ setup, this is what the echo buffer
says when I press ~Super-f~ for the left super button (while in normal

And for the right super key:

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-s-f is undefined
#+END_SRC

Ah!  Notice the ~M~ when pressing the right, which is not there when
pressing the left.  I am guessing that this has to do with the fact that
I map the ~AltGr~ key (right alt) to act like “alt”, i.e., to act like
the right alt key.

** DONE Use some hyper keybinding to change layouts or groups :issue-closed:
   CLOSED: [2017-09-01 Fri 12:41]

  - CLOSING NOTE [2017-09-01 Fri 12:41] \\
    I have set up four group switching keys accessible on one of the
    extend layers (the seventh layer).  So making keybindings to those
    using hyper is not needed.
I have managed to get the hyper modifier up and running today, on
~no-p4~.  The first thing I could use it for is to use some hyper
keybinding to change layouts or groups.  That way I could use ~no-p4~
and then switch to ~no-p3~ when I need to change windows, since Xmonad
does not work well with ~no-p4~ (that has to do with modifiers).

** DONE Return and Backspace keys don’t work with a certain group switch setup :issue-closed:
   CLOSED: [2017-09-01 Fri 12:43]

  - CLOSING NOTE [2017-09-01 Fri 12:43] \\
    I haven’t found a solution for this specific issue, but it is not really
    relevant any more since I have set up group switching keys on one of
    the extend layer (seventh layer) that does work for all keys.
I’ve been trying this setup for switching between groups:

#+BEGIN_SRC
xkb_symbols "group-switches" {
    key <RTRN> { [ RTRN, RTRN, RTRN, ISO_Next_Group ] };
    key <BKSP> { [ Backspace, Backspace, Backspace, ISO_Prev_Group ] };
};
#+END_SRC

Which ~no-p3~ and ~no-p4~ use:

#+BEGIN_SRC
// Like `no-p2`, but with an “alphabetic numpad”.
xkb_symbols "no-p3" {
    include "twin-dexter(no-p2)"
    include "twin-dexter(group-switches)"
…
xkb_symbols "no-p4" {
    include "twin-dexter(no-p2)"
    include "twin-dexter(group-switches)"
…
#+END_SRC

My keyboard setup looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# Set keyboard layouts and options relating to keyboard layouts
# NOTE: the `-compat` option is so that level 2 latch works properly.
setxkbmap -option "" -layout "twin-dexter(no-p3),twin-dexter(no-p4)" \
         -compat my-complete \
         -option grp:sclk_toggle \
         -option grp_led:scroll :2 \
         -option nbsp:none -print |
             xkbcomp -I"/home/kristoffer/xkb/xkb-tree" - "$DISPLAY"
#+END_SRC

So the first grop is ~no-p3~ and the second is ~no-p4~.

The problem is that when I have ~no-p3~ selected I can use return and
backslash as usual on the lower levels (on level four they choose the
next and previous group, respectively), but if I switch to ~no-p4~,
these keys produce ~NoSymbol~ when unshifted (level 1), but can emit the
group switches on the fourt level.

*** Update 2017-07-08T16:51:01+0200

According to ~xev~, the return and backspace keys both emit ~NoSymbol~
at level 2 and 3, the group switches at level 4, and the regular
symbols unshifted for ~no-p3~.  So I am unable to make newlines and
backspaces with ~no-p3~ when I am on the second and third level.  For
~no-p4~ I am unable to do these two things, since it emits ~NoSymbol~
for all but the fourth level.

I also tested switching the second layout to another layout to see if
the issue was with something else than ~no-p4~:

#+BEGIN_SRC
# Set keyboard layouts and options relating to keyboard layouts
# NOTE: the `-compat` option is so that level 2 latch works properly.
setxkbmap -option "" -layout "twin-dexter(no-p3),no" \
         -compat my-complete \
         -option grp:sclk_toggle \
         -option grp_led:scroll :2 \
         -option nbsp:none -print |
             xkbcomp -I"/home/kristoffer/xkb/xkb-tree" - "$DISPLAY"
#+END_SRC

(~no~ is the second layout.)

But ~no~ acts the same as ~no-p3~.  So the issue is apparently with
~no-p4~.

I tried to do two things to try to find the problematic part of ~no-p4~:

1. Remove the part that customizes the latches.
2. Remove the part that adds the Hyper keys.

But neither of these worked.

*** Update  2017-07-08T17:15:28+0200

I removed almost everything from ~no-p4~ to see if the problem
persisted:

#+BEGIN_SRC
xkb_symbols "no-p4" {
    include "twin-dexter(no-p2)"
    include "twin-dexter(group-switches)"
};
#+END_SRC

And yes, return and backspace then still didn’t work on ~no-p4~.

*** Update 2017-07-08T17:30:30+0200

I tried to move the include of the group switch last in both ~no-p3~,
~no-p4~.  That did not make any difference.

** Control and alt keys on extend layers don’t work with latch keys :issue-closed:

*Update 2017-10-25*: Like mentioned in an update further down this
behaviour is pretty much to be expected.  It’s not an issue per se, but
but I’ll keep it around since it can serve as an explanation for the
behavior.

---

Right now I can access left control and left alt on the extend layers on
the ~Q~ and ~F~ keys, respectively.  This works perfectly if I press
down the different shift keys in the regular way (non-latch) in order to
access these keys (or, symbols on these layers).  However, there is a
hitch if I access these layers with the latch shift key behavior.  What
happens then is that, after having pressed either left control or left
alt, the next keypress after that will be consumed as an extend layer
keypress.  It is as if pressing these two modifier keys does not
“consume” the latch states; instead, the key pressed after that consumes
them.

Here is a concrete example.  First ~ISO_Level5_Latch~ is pressed and
released, then ~ISO_Level3_Latch~ is pressed and released.  At this
point we have latched levels 5 and 3 and hence the next normal key is
going to be “accessed” on its seventh layer.  Then we press ~Q~ and
release, which has ~Control_L~ mapped to this level.  I now expect this
to have consumed the latch key states, and so there is no active
latches.  But this is wrong according to Xev.  If I, right after having
pressed ~Q~, press the ~H~, the keypress event is not a lowercase ~h~
but is instead ~Left~ (according to Xev).  Why ~Left~?   Well, the ~H~
key is mapped to ~Left~ on the seventh layer, so the latch key states
must still be active.  Then the ~H~ key is pressed again.  Now a
lowercase ~h~ is the keypress event, as expected.  So the first key
pressed after pressing the left control must have consumed the latch key
states.

*** Update 2017-09-02T01:29:51+02:00

On further reflection, a control key not consuming the latch states
makes perfect sense.  When I for example want to press ~Control+D~ by
first latching the ~Shift~ key and then pressing ~Control+d~, I don’t
want or expect pressing the Control key to consume the latch state.  In
fact, that would make it impossible to use keys like the control keys in
concert with the latch shift keys, since the control keys need to
pressed slightly before the keys they are pressed together with, like
~D~.

Anyway, I tried to look into a way to make this unusual case work.
First I tried to find out more about /actions/, since they seem to be
the place where I need to make changes in order to make this thing
work.  I had a look at An Unreliable Guide and I found
[[https://www.charvolant.org/doug/xkb/html/node5.html#SECTION00055000000000000000][this section]], which describes the different actions that can be
associated with keys.  Tables 2–4 describes actions and fields for
actions.  This is the only place I found that documents these things.  I
also had a look at some of the files in the ~X11/compat~ directory.  In
addition, I also had a look in the ~X11/type~ directory.

I tried to change the actions of seventh layer control key in many
ways.  The action that is defined for this key as of now is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
actions[Group1] = [
    // Do not set any action for non-Extend layer keys.
    NoAction(), NoAction(), NoAction(), NoAction(),
    NoAction(), NoAction(),
    // We need to set appropriate actions for control keys.
    SetMods(mods=Control), SetMods(mods=Shift+Control)
]
#+END_EXAMPLE

I tried to change ~SetMods(mods=Control)~ in such a way as to both set
~Control~ as a modifier, and also consume/release the two active latches
(level 3 and 5).  All of the attempts were unsuccessful.  Right now I
suspect that I focused on actions that were meant to clear
(consume/release) /held down/ modifiers, while I wanted to eliminate
latched modifiers.  If that makes sense.

**** What now?

Solving this problem would make a very niché use-case for this control
key possible: latch two levels in order to get to a control key on the
alphabetic section.  I don’t even know if I ever would find that to be
practical, as compared to holding down the two shifts as regular shifts
and then pressing the control key.  So this problem is too hard for the
reward to bother with.

In case I come back to this for some reason, I should ask someone else
about this.

* TODO use xkb indicators in status bar

I want to show keyboard state in the status bar/system tray.  Things
like the lock/latch state of all the shift keys.

* TODO check out ~ISO_Lock~

* TODO Perhaps use AsciiDoc for documentation

AsciiDoc might be a nice tool.  It seems geared towards technical
documentation.

** DONE Can you latch modifiers like control and hyper? :issue-closed:
  CLOSED: [2019-04-06 Sat 23:44]

  - CLOSING NOTE [2019-04-06 Sat 23:44] \\
    Just tested with control.  This worked as expected/hoped:

    #+BEGIN_SRC
    …
    replace key <LFSH> {
    symbols[Group1] = [
        Control_R
    ],
    actions[Group1] = [
        latchMods(modifiers=Control)
    ]
    };
    …
    #+END_SRC

    Hyper might be trickier, but for unrelated reasons (the fact that it
    is tied to the same modifier (~mod2~) as ~NumLock~).

Apparently this is how the latch action is defined (taken from
~xkb/compat/iso9995):

#+BEGIN_SRC
action= LatchMods(modifiers=LevelThree);
#+END_SRC

~Hyper~ is a modifier.  I’ve seen it been used like this:
~modifiers=Hyper~.  So maybe one can implement latch keys for things
like control and hyper?  That could be useful.
