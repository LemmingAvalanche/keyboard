Copy whatever xkb files you have to the directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC generic
/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols
#+END_SRC

Remember to remove the files in this directory when you have made modifications
to one of the files in that directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC generic
/var/lib/xkb/
#+END_SRC

You don't have to restart the computer in order for the new key mappings to take
effect; just restart lightdm:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo restart lightdm
#+END_SRC

Set keymappings with Setxkbmap.  For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
setxkbmap no_p1
#+END_SRC

If there is some file named ~no_p1~ in ~/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols~.

Or set the ~nodeadkeys~ variant:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
setxkbmap "no_p1(nodeadkeys)"
#+END_SRC

The quotes are necessary because of the shell.
